            Who am I?
        </h2>
        <p>
                My name is Aditya Sharma and I am from Singapore. I have a younger brother who is 11 years old. I am a Computer Science student. I am passionate about technology and love to explore new programming languages and frameworks. In my free time, I enjoy watching Bolywood movies, reading books, and playing video games. I have just finished my first year of high school and am excited to continue my studies in the field of computer science. I am also interested in web development and have started learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from the University of Michigan's online course.

            Singapore is a small island city-state located in Southeast Asia. It is known for its multicultural society, modern architecture, and efficient public transportation system. The country has a tropical climate and is famous for its cleanliness and safety. Singapore is also a global financial hub and attracts many expatriates from around the world. The official languages are English, Malay, Mandarin, and Tamil. I have loved in Singapore since 2017, completing 8 years this year.
